I studied which aspects of the ERK dynamic signaling can a translocation-based sensor capture in single cells. This project is framed in a collaboration between Dr. Morelli's group and Dr. Schr√∂ter's lab. You can explore the numerical and computational part of this project [here](https://github.com/fiorefabris/ERK_sensor_dyn).
