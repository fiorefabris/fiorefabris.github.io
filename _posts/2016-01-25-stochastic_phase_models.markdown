I studied the effect of different types of noise in phase oscillator models, and got the minimal theoretical description of intermittent oscillations phenom detected in ERK signaling dynamics in Embryonic Stem Cells. You can explore the numerical and computational part of this project [here](https://github.com/fiorefabris/stochastic_phase_models).
