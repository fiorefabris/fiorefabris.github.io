I built the first quantitative description of ERK dynamic signaling from time-lapse movies of Embryonic Stem Cells. I described these signaling dynamics with a new type of dynamics termed intermittent oscillations. This project is framed in a collaboration between Dr. Morelli's group and Dr. Schr√∂ter's lab. This research project was published [here](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/149/4/dev199710/274396/Intermittent-ERK-oscillations-downstream-of-FGF-in), and you can further explore the package I builded for time series quantitative characterization [here](https://github.com/fiorefabris/DynCode).
